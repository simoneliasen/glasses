The "glasses" project aims to do facial recognition and serve meassurements of the face back to the user, the end goal will be a business application

This project was developed, to play around with Flask, Opencv (Facial recognition), Machine learning, numpy and deployment with an ORM or RDM. Furthermore to play with a bit of UI design and Javascript 

To do:
- Pass uploaded image to ml app, and show new image on page
- Add advancements in face recognition and collect data
- Setup stylesheet


Considerations:
- Settle on db integration (sql-alchemy, what's avaliable on heroku?)
- Can this site be runned embed?
