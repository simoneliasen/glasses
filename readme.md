The "glasses" project aims to do facial recognition and serve meassurements of the face back to the user, the end goal will be identifying faceshapes via machine learning, and come with suggestion to the user on haircuts and glass selection.

This project was developed, to play around with Flask, Opencv (Facial recognition), Machine learning, numpy and deployment with  ORM or RDM. Furthermore to play with a bit of UI design and Javascript 

To do:
- Advance the current face recognition model
- Create image test set, and model therefrom
- Optimize for performance
- Test in the wild

Considerations:
- Settle on db integration (sql-alchemy, what's avaliable on heroku?)
- Securing each user session
- Running embeded?
